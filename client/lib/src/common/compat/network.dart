///
///  @abstract A network type to indicate what kind the entity is.
///
///  @discussion An address can identify a person, a group of people,
///      a team, even a thing.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Main indicates this entity is a person's account.
///      An account should have a public key, which proved by meta data.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Group indicates this entity is a group of people,
///      which should have a founder (also the owner), and some members.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Moments indicates a special personal social network,
///      where the owner can share information and interact with its friends.
///      The owner is the king here, it can do anything and no one can stop it.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Polylogue indicates a virtual (temporary) social network.
///      It's created to talk with multi-people (but not too much, e.g. less than 100).
///      Any member can invite people in, but only the founder can expel member.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Chatroom indicates a massive (persistent) social network.
///      It's usually more than 100 people in it, so we need administrators
///      to help the owner to manage the group.
///

///
///      MKMNetwork_Department indicates this entity is a department.
///
///      MKMNetwork_Thing this is reserved for IoT (Internet of Things).
///
///  Bits:
///      0000 0001 - this entity's branch is independent (clear division).
///      0000 0010 - this entity can contains other group (big organization).
///      0000 0100 - this entity is top organization.
///      0000 1000 - (MAIN) this entity acts like a human.
///
///      0001 0000 - this entity contains members (Group)
///      0010 0000 - this entity needs other administrators (big organization)
///      0100 0000 - this is an entity in reality.
///      1000 0000 - (IoT) this entity is a 'Thing'.
